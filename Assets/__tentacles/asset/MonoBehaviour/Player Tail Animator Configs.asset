  slitheryDescription: "Blending Slithery - smooth & soft tentacle-like movement (value = 1)\nwith more stiff & springy motion (value = 0)\n\n0: Stiff somewhat like tree branch\n1: Soft like squid tentacle / Animal tail"
  slithery: 0
  curlingDescription: How curly motion should be applied to tail segments
  curling: 0
  springinessDescription: Elastic spring effect making motion more 'meaty'
  springiness: 0
  maxStretchingDescription: Max Stretching is limiting distance between each tail segment, when you set this value high you allow the tail to stretch more and it can provide more smooth effect for tail motion, but sometimes full limiting (to value = 0) can provide much different and interesting motion effect.
